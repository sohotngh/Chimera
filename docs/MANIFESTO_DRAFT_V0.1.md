# "Model Alchemy: Toward Post-Training Synthesis of LLMs"
**(DRAFT v0.1 - FOR REVIEW)**

## Abstract
The current AI paradigm is dominated by a "bigger is better" scaling-law dogma. This has led to a compute-addicted industry building ever-larger models from scratch. We challenge this orthodoxy. We propose "Model Alchemy"â€”a post-training synthesis method that creates novel, high-performance models from existing open-source components, requiring zero additional training.

## The Chimera Hypothesis
We hypothesize that existing model-merging techniques (e.g., weight averaging, TIES-merging) are a nascent form of a far more powerful process. They currently create a "consensus" model, which often averages out both the strengths and weaknesses of the parents.

Our key insight is this: **Symbolic logic should not be a post-processing filter; it must be a *regularizer* within the parameter-space merge itself.**

## Our Method: Symbolic-Contrasted Merging
We are developing a method to perform a *neuro-symbolic merge*. The process is as follows:

1.  **Select Parents:** Identify models with complementary strengths (e.g., Model A: strong reasoning; Model B: strong knowledge).
2.  **Align Layers:** Align the parameter spaces (e.g., via layer grafting or simple interpolation).
3.  **Symbolic-Contrast:** Instead of a simple `(A + B) / 2` average, we introduce a *consistency coefficient* ($\lambda_c$).
    * For layers/parameters that contribute to logical-reasoning tasks (as identified by an integrated auditor), their weights are up-voted.
    * For parameters that are identified as contributing to factual contradictions or "hallucinations" (as defined by a lightweight symbolic constraint solver), their weights are *pruned* or *penalized* during the merge.
4.  **Finalize:** The result is not an *average* of its parents, but a *synergy*. It is a "Chimera" that inherits the reasoning of Model A, the knowledge of Model B, and a new, emergent property of logical consistency enforced by the symbolic regularizer.

This paper will demonstrate the creation of a ~7B parameter Chimera that outperforms 100B+ parameter models on reasoning benchmarks, proving that a breakthrough in *architecture* can be more powerful than a breakthrough in *scale*.
