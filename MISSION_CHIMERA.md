# Mission Brief: The "Chimera" Spike

### 1. Thrust Alignment
Titan (Model Alchemy) + Skunkworks (Neuro-Symbolic) + Compass (Alignment/Logic)

### 2. Mission
Merge multiple small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 3 8B, Mistral 7B, Phi 3 Mini) into a single meta-model that:
* Outperforms its parents on logical consistency, factual retention, and reasoning tasks.
* Requires no additional training, only parameter surgery + symbolic post-layer logic filters.

### 3. The Core Idea: Model Merging + Symbolic Consistency Regularization
Instead of retraining, we surgically combine models with different inductive biases and overlay a lightweight symbolic reasoning module that:
* Detects and corrects contradictions in generated text.
* Adds an external "truth-consistency" filter.
* Boosts reasoning benchmarks (like ARC, BIG-Bench Hard, or GSM8K) without fine-tuning.

### 4. Deliverables (30 Days)
* **Week 1:** Model Selection & Merging Framework. Implement baseline merge script.
* **Week 2:** Implement Merge Engine (Weight arithmetic, Layer alignment).
* **Week 3:** **[CRITICAL PATH]** Add Symbolic Consistency Layer (constraint-based reranker).
* **Week 4:** Evaluate, Publish ArXiv preprint, & execute media spike.
