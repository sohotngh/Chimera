# Project Chimera

**Thrust Alignment:** Titan + Skunkworks + Compass
**Tagline:** Three minds fused into oneâ€”a new species of intelligence, born without training.

## Mission

To prove that insight beats resources. We are creating a meta-model by surgically merging multiple small open-source LLMs into a single entity that outperforms its parents on logic and reasoning, *without* a single new training step.

## Status

**Phase 1 (30-Day Spike):** Active.
**Current Task:** [Week 1] Baseline merge implementation and parent model benchmarking.

This repository is the "War Room" for our two-person insurgency.
Maximum Ambition, Minimum Footprint.
