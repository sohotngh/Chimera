# Project Chimera

**Thrust Alignment:** Titan + Skunksworks + Compass
**Tagline:** Three minds fused into oneâ€”a new species of intelligence, born without training.

## Mission

To prove that insight beats resources. We are creating a meta-model by surgically merging multiple small open-source LLMs into a single entity that outperforms its parents on logic and reasoning, *without* a single new training step.

## Status

**Phase 1 (Output-Fusion):** COMPLETE.
**Milestone:** `v0.2-output-fusion`
**Result:** Statistically significant +13 point accuracy gain (Chimera 85% vs. Best-Parent 72%) on benchmark tasks. LSV-v0.2 (Weighted Voting) validated.

**Phase 2 (Parameter-Space Fusion):** Pending activation.
